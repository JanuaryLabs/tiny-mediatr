# Getting Started with Tiny-MediatR: A Wondrous Adventure Awaits!

Gather around, curious developers! Our whimsical journey through the enchanted land of Tiny-MediatR continues as we embark on the next phase of our adventure: getting started with the library. Fear not, for the path ahead is filled with excitement, discovery, and perhaps even a touch of magic. ‚ú®

## 1. Installing the Magical Potion üß™üîÆ

Before we can explore the wonders of Tiny-MediatR, we must first summon the library into our project. With a simple incantation, we can conjure the package and add it to our application:

```bash
npm i @faslh/tiny-mediatr
```

## 2. Crafting Your Command Scrolls üìú‚úçÔ∏è

With Tiny-MediatR installed, it's time to assemble our cast of characters. First, let's create a command that will carry our request through the magical kingdom:

```ts
import { IRequest } from "./mediator";

export class SampleRequest implements IRequest<string> {
  constructor(public message: string) {}
}
```

## 3. Summoning Your Brave Handlers ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏è

Next, we'll summon a handler to carry out the command's bidding:

```ts
import { IRequestHandler, RequestHandler } from "./mediator";

@RequestHandler(SampleRequest)
export class SampleRequestHandler
  implements IRequestHandler<SampleRequest, string>
{
  async handle(request: SampleRequest): Promise<string> {
    return `Request handled: ${request.message}`;
  }
}
```

## 4. Casting Your Spell üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

```ts
// SampleNotification.ts
import {
  INotification,
  INotificationHandler,
  NotificationHandler,
} from "./mediator";

export class SampleNotification implements INotification {
  constructor(public message: string) {}
}

@NotificationHandler(SampleNotification)
export class FirstSampleNotificationHandler
  implements INotificationHandler<SampleNotification>
{
  async handle(notification: SampleNotification): Promise<void> {
    console.log(
      `FirstSampleNotificationHandler:Notification handled: ${notification.message}`
    );
  }
}
@NotificationHandler(SampleNotification)
export class SecondSampleNotificationHandler
  implements INotificationHandler<SampleNotification>
{
  async handle(notification: SampleNotification): Promise<void> {
    console.log(
      `SecondSampleNotificationHandler:Notification handled: ${notification.message}`
    );
  }
}
```

## 5. Unleashing the Power of Tiny-MediatR

With our command and handler in place, it's time to witness the magic of Tiny-MediatR in action. Let's create an instance of the Mediator class and send our GreetCommand on its merry way:

```ts
(async () => {
  // Register the Mediator
  Injector.AddScoped(Mediator);

  // Create a new context
  const context = new Context();

  // Resolve the Mediator instance
  const mediator = Injector.GetRequiredService(Mediator, context);

  // Send a request
  const request = new SampleRequest("Hello, World!");
  const response = await mediator.send<string>(request);
  console.log(response); // Output: Request handled: Hello, World!

  // Publish a notification
  const notification = new SampleNotification("Hello, World!");
  await mediator.publish(notification); // Output: Notification handled: Hello, World!
})();
```

## 6. Exploring Further: Notifications and Pipelines

Our adventure doesn't end here! The enchanted land of Tiny-MediatR has many more wonders to discover, like notifications and pipelines. As you venture forth, you'll find that these powerful features can help you create even more magical applications.

And there you have it, brave developer! You're now well on your way to becoming a master of Tiny-MediatR. May your journey be filled with excitement, discovery, and endless possibilities! üöÄüåü
